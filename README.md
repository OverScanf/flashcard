# flashcard
My automation project with ANKI

1. Create list of word in Russian inside a file (look at test.txt for instance)
2. Launch the flashcard application
3. Indicate the output file as HTML : each word would be illustrated in a table !
4. Enter y if you want to export your illustrated table as a csv ready to work with ANKI !
